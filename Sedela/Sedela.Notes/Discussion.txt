the latter seems to be what people want from such a tool
I think Conal's TCM opened up a novel space - one that I'm attempting to explore here with Sedela.
Yes, constraints could be interesting in the generation technique.
So, let's say I said, "The semantics are (defined as) any evaluation rules that preserve this type relation".
What semantic tool (denotative, operational, or otherwise) might be recommended for expressing that?
It seems that operational semantics is too narrow a tool.

You could say that in Agda w operational semantics by doing in existential over the reduction relation

record Semantics (|-_:_ : Rel Term Type) where
  field
    _-->_ : Rel Term Term
    type-sound : forall M N t
      -> (|- M : t)
      -> (M --> N)
      -> (|- N : t)
